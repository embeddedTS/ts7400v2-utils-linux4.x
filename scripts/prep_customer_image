# This script uses a number of commands and parses their output.  The output

# a reference to our customers to note what files are important when creating
# a "golden" image for a production process.  It should be used carefully, and
# all image files produced by this script should be throughly checked before
# being officially released.

# This file is used to test and prepare an image for release. There are board
# specific tests that occur first, and then all of the generic test/prep
# occurs.
#
# Note that this script is tailored to an end customer preparing an image.
# Some of our standard preparations are not done as they would likely not be
# wanted in an end application
#
# Run `prep_image /dev/<whole device> <imagename>`
# Or `prep_image <imagename>.dd[.bz2,.gz]`
# Source image is only read and not modified
# Current user must be root, or, user must have proper permissions
#
# Generic tests/preperation include:
#   If $1 is dev node, create 64kbyte aligned image that is at least
#     one sector longer than the last sector listed in fdisk
#   Verify .dd is 64kbyte aligned
#   fsck last partition
#   Mount last partition
#   Remove /etc/ssh/*key*  # Done to ensure each device has unique key
#   Touch /firstboot to cause re-gen of SSH keys on first boot
#   Remove and touch /etc/machine-id # Done to ensure each device is unique
#   Remove /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
#   Comment "#" /etc/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules
#   Remove /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules # Prevents network issues
#   Remove /var/log/*, only files, leave folder tree intact
#   Remove any packages in /var/cache/apt/archives (equiv. to apt-get clean)
#   Remove temporary/unique files
#     /.readahead
#     /run/utmp
#     /etc/adjtime
#     /var/lib/systemd/random-seed
#   Set /root.version-cust to current date
#   Set up /etc/hosts from /etc/hostname, use Debian defaults otherwise
#   If /boot/Image exists, pull linux version from this file, and remove all
#     /lib/modules/ dirs that are NOT matching this version
#   Run any board specific scripts in PREP_SCRIPTS
#   Create /md5sums.txt of all of the md5sums of files in rootfs
#   Create tarball of filesystem
#   Zero FS for compression
#   Unmount FS
#   Post image production scripts in POST_SCRIPTS
#   Compress image as xz, and generate md5s for .dd and .dd.xz
